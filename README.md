Data Analysis on the Washington Post Police Shooting Databas

I wanted to do similar analysis to https://github.com/springcoil/EDA_data_police_shootings, but weighting what percentages 
different races were in respect to the total population. I did this since total numbers have lack significance unless you look at how disproportionate the incidences are. 

Results: Native Americans had ~220% and Black Americans had ~190% more incidences of gun violence against them by the police than the population expected value. 

NOTE: I did not weight threat level or any other column of data. This is just some quick analysis I did out of curiosity so no 
sociological conclusions should be made.
